        h2 Summary
          p The first couple of weeks were spent doing 2 things. The first, negotiating how the unit will run, what the unit is about, and why covering exactly why we are doing this unit and what we can expect from it.  This is a pretty standard start to an ordinary unit, but since ELEC436 is anything but an ordinary unit, there were some finer points that needed to be made clear early on in the semester. 
          p A large portion of time was spent deliberating over the definition of a professional and the definition of a software engineer.  At some points this was purely semantics, others, carefully explained scenarios and real-world differences between software engineers and others. 
          p A large goal of this unit was to decisively select topics that, throughout your time at uni, you may have completely missed or felt you need to brush up on. Due to the way the degree is set out, at times selecting one option unit over another meant that you will have knowledge gap. The introductory weeks were spent analysing the ACS-EA joint boards software engineering competencies and selecting topics that you may have missed, these topics would be the focal point of your semester in ELEC436.

          p A professional was defined as somebody who exhibits the following traits
            ul
              li Continues professional development 
              li Has a body of knowledge
              li Works autonomously 
              li Has a set of standards
              li Has a set code of ethics/morality
              li Has technical Skills
              li Has social responsibility and power
              li A software engineer was defined as either having 
              li Creativity skills
              li Project management skills
              li Planning skills 
              li Risk management skills
              li Resource management skills
              li A set methodology
              li Problem solving capability
          p The work software engineers produce differs from other types of engineering because the output is/has
            ul
              li Intangible
              li Deterministic
              li Able to be updated
              li Malleable
              li Continually developing
              li Infinite distance capability
              li Large global business advantages
              li Different Manufacturing procedures
              li Different maintenance procedures
          p There was a little discussion on the usefulness of professional groups such as IEEE, ACS, APESMA, ACM, EA and the benefits these groups provide.

        h2 Reflection
          p When you look back at these weeks you ask yourself why you would spend time in a 4th year unit discussing the definition of a software engineer and a professional, surely this should be covered in a  1st year engineering unit. Surprisingly nobody could autonomously define both a professional and Software engineer encompassing all of the topics above and I think that this was largely the point. How can you be an effective professional software engineer if you t recall what a professional software engineer is without thinking about it? The reiteration of the importance of professional societies was something that may have been brushed off in 1st or 2nd year when you were first introduced to them, and only now in 4th year do you truly realise their benefit
          p Finding the knowledge gap in my degree made me realise that my degree t truly encompassing for a software engineer and there was still plenty more that I needed to learn, even when compared to other s degrees. This was even included in the definition of a professional and continuing professional development is something that will be done for the duration of my career as a software engineer.

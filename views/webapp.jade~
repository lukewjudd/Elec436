        h2 Summary
          p After looking at the software engineering competencies and the overarching goal of ELEC436, I selected the startup engineering course run by Stanford uni . The details of the course can be found at:
(a href='https://www.coursera.org/course/startup') Startup
          p The definition of the course itself was - Learn the engineering skills needed to build a technology startup from the ground up. 
          p There were a few key reasons I selected this as something I should know and be spending time on while at university. The key topics and reasons for this choice were

              li Linux environment development
              li Frontend/Backend development
              li Production environment
              li Development scaling
              li Business scaling
              li Latest technology implementation
              li Project/resource management skills
          p The goals and competencies required for this course were greatly applicable to ACS-s software engineering competencies. On a personal level, I do not feel like my ENGG411 thesis was a project I could be proud of, so completing a project like this covered many large project skills I feel I missed out on. It also encompasses something I am passionate about and uses the latest technologies available in web development, which seems like a fitting project considering it is intended as a transition from a university type class into a professional workplace environment.

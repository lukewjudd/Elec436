        h2 Summary
        p This project was selected by Mike to fill a gap he believed that I had missed and was important to my degree. The project was to select any of the numerous disasters that had occurred solely through software misbehaving. After selecting a disaster, study the leading causes of the disaster and come up with a disaster pattern.  The project included a report and formal presentation of our findings. The major goal of this project was to identify the underlying issue rather than a specific issue, that could be identified by myself in a project before a similar disaster occurred. The secondary goal was to come to a realisation of the power and responsibility some software engineers have, in contrast to  the previous definition of the Intangible, malleable, and continuous development most software engineers deal with daily.
